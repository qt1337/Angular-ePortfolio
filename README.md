# Angular CLI

This project exists as part of my Angular ePortfolio. <br>
View on [GitHub Pages](https://qt1337.github.io/Angular-ePortfolio/).

## How do I run this locally?

Clone this repository and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. <br>
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. <br>

## How do I create my own Angular Application?

1. Run `ng new my-app` to create a new app. <br>
2. Now navigate into the newly generated folder with `cd my-app`. <br>
3. If you want to launch the server run `ng serve --open` (`--open` to open the page automatically). <br>
4. Now a demo app should have been opened. That's your first application written with Angular CLI <br>
5. Go and check out this [tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial) for more knowledge about Angular CLI. <br>
